#### Ellie:
Controls were always a number 1 consideration so we have an action button for attacking and a jump button where double jump activates web swinging.

#### Alex:
The player has states which control the behaviour as well as physics properties such as the rigidbody's drag or gravity scale.

The player movement...

#### Ellie:
The web swinging is one of the player states, and the gravity scale is increased to increase the swing speed. Playtesting showed people wanted to use the horizontal axis to increase swing velocity, so that was implemented as well as moving up and down the web. Additionally, when letting go of the swing the velocity is kept until the player is grounded again so catapulting through the level is theoretically possible if someone wants to speedrun.
